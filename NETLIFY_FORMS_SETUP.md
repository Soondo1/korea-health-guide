# Netlify Forms Setup - Complete Guide

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Static HTML Form for Detection
- **File**: `public/contact-form.html`
- **Purpose**: Allows Netlify to detect your form during build time
- **Status**: âœ… Created

### 2. Updated ContactForm Component
- **File**: `src/components/ContactForm.tsx`
- **Changes Made**:
  - âœ… Added proper honeypot field for spam prevention
  - âœ… Fixed form submission to use correct format for Netlify
  - âœ… Maintained existing validation and sanitization

### 3. Form Configuration
- **Form Name**: `contact`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Fields**: name, surname, email, message
- **Anti-spam**: Honeypot field (`bot-field`)

## How to Test

### After Deployment:
1. **Deploy your site** to Netlify
2. **Visit your live site** and go to the homepage
3. **Fill out the contact form** with test data
4. **Submit the form**
5. **Check Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to your site dashboard
   - Click on "Forms" in the sidebar
   - You should see your "contact" form listed
   - View submissions under that form

### Netlify Dashboard Path:
```
Your Site Dashboard â†’ Forms â†’ contact â†’ View form submissions
```

## What Happens When Someone Submits:

1. **Client-side validation** runs first
2. **Form data is sanitized** for security
3. **Rate limiting** prevents spam (3 submissions per 5 minutes)
4. **Data is sent to Netlify** using their form handling
5. **User sees success message**
6. **You receive notification** (if configured in Netlify)

## Setting Up Notifications (Optional):

1. In Netlify Dashboard, go to **Site Settings**
2. Click **Forms** in the sidebar
3. Click **Form notifications**
4. Add email notification:
   - **Event**: New form submission
   - **Email**: Your email address
   - **Form**: contact

## Troubleshooting:

### Form Not Detected:
- Make sure `public/contact-form.html` is deployed
- Check that build completed successfully
- Verify form name matches exactly ("contact")

### Submissions Not Working:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're testing on the live site (not localhost)
- Check if there are any CORS issues

### Not Receiving Notifications:
- Check spam folder
- Verify notification settings in Netlify Dashboard
- Test with a different email address

- âœ… **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are cleaned
- âœ… **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection
- âœ… **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam submissions
